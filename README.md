A very rough proof of concept.

A friend of mine wanted an app that would display a player's progress through a dungeon, 
reveal rooms and items and produce flavor text.  Essentially a program that would play the "Dungeon Master" role 
in a dungeon crawl scenario.

I threw this together to demonstrate how such a thing could be accomplished with HTML, CSS and JS.
Might expand on the idea in the future.
